# CSGO-Aimbot-CNN
CS:GO Aimbot based on convolutional neural networks.

# How it works
The program will capture the screen then it will</br>
detect whether a ct solider in the frame. If there is it will</br>
aim to his head and shoot.</br>
</br>
The entire process will be displayed at your screen.</br>
But you have to play on fullscreen windowed so overlay will be displayed. And</br>
turn off raw input so the aimbot will work.
